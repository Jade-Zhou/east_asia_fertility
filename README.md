# More educated Women, Lower fertility rate? An analysis into the relationship between fertility decline and female education in Southeast Asia

## Jue Zhou

In this project, I investigated into the relationship between fertility decline and female education using the cases of several southeast Asian countries: Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam.

Data I used in my analysis comes from **Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital** (Available at [this link](http://dataexplorer.wittgensteincentre.org/wcde-v2/).)
All my data can be found in the `data` folder. You can also download the data on the website I provide above by scrolling down the indicator type, indicator, country list, sex, and year.

You can read my report [here]().

The Rmd file can be accessed [here]().
